Over the past five logged days I have eaten four items at each of four daily meals—breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack and dinner—averaging about 17 fl oz of food that delivers roughly 1,020 kcal, 63 g protein, 38 g fat, 96 g carbohydrates (26 g of that as sugar) and 1,513 mg sodium per meal; in total that is about 68 fl oz and 4,085 kcal per day with 252 g protein, 154 g fat, 385 g carbohydrates (105 g sugar) and 6,052 mg sodium. All meals are strictly halal and completely nut-free, 63 % of my choices are vegetarian and 25 % are fully vegan, half are gluten-free, and roughly one-third include lactose, which I tolerate in moderation. My goal is to preserve this balance—high protein (~60 g per meal), moderate calories (~1,000 kcal per meal) and sugars and sodium kept below about 6,500 mg per day—while ensuring every recommendation respects my mandatory halal and nut-free requirements and generally favours vegetarian dishes, with gluten or lactose allowed in limited amounts.
